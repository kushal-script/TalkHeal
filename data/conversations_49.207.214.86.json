While I can't provide medical advice, I can share some poses that are often suggested for lifting mood and promoting a sense of well-being. Practices like Child's Pose, gentle backbends like Cobra Pose, and forward folds such as Standing Forward Bend can be helpful. Remember to listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable. If you're new to yoga, it might be beneficial to find a qualified instructor who can guide you. How are you feeling emotionally and physically right now?",
